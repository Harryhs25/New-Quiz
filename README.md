# New-Quiz-After-GITBUG
Harry's Cooking Quiz
This website is basically just meant to be a short quiz that keeps track of player's/users scores and asks them fairly simple baking and
cooking questions. The target audience for the site is basically anyone that has interest in cooking and wants to test their cooking knowledge.
# Existing Features
The features of this page include the following:
home page which allows you to navigate from the actual quiz as well as the "scores" page. ![FrontPage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052254/138388486-6b23457d-a3cb-4bec-8972-07a54cc8371d.png)
a quiz which logs your score (score is accumalated by answering questions correctly) which goes up by 100 points at a time.
score page which gives the user the option to log their highscore into the scores part of the site. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052254/138388668-fb52bcaa-ea43-4995-83fa-43b98e244dd6.png)
multiple questions with right and wrong answers which change colour based on whether you get an answer right ot wrong. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052254/138388585-6491bbb0-da96-4b83-a82f-4538cb755f50.png)
# The Game Results
based on the javascript effectivley what happens is when the user click "play" the questions are generated in a randomised order.
this is effectivley to stop anyone fro mmorising what the answers are based on their location. this effectvley forces the player/user to read the question.
AFter the user has finished the quiz they would have accumalated some points (or none) which they can then display in the scores section if they decide to log their highscore.
# Rules
The rules are simply read and answer the questions correctly by clicking on the answer you beleive to be correct.
# Testing
- I have tested the game on various browsers, chrome, firefox and safari.
- I have confirmed that the game results are always correct (questions answers are the same).
- I have gotten other people to access my work (friends from work) to make sure footers and any text is easy to understand a view.
# Bugs (There were a lot)
- The first major bug worth mentioing is that on my original GIT I created for this project the code would simply not load the HighScore page. AFter much trial and error i eventually decided to create a new GIT. The original can be found here https://github.com/Harryhs25/Cool-Quiz.git after creating the new GIT everything seemed to run smoothly.
- Another bug I encountered was due to me seeking help from a friend in mysecond course where he replaced some of my example questions which lead to the questions not being displayed at all and the next pages for the quiz not being loaded. I eventually fixed this by watching a few tutorials and getting my questions to display again.
- The last major setback or bug i encountered was when i initially began setting up the project and my variables wouldnt pick up in other scripts such as ID'S or Classes in HTML not being targeted by CSS or JavaScript. This was eventually solved as i renamed all my variables.
- Other bugs encountered were mainly text not displaying or showing up as the wrong colour in the live view of the site.
Unfixed Bugs
- there were no unfixed bugs that i encountered.
#Validator Testing
(HTML)
- No errors wee returned when passing through the official W3C validator
(CSS)
- No errors wee returned when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator 
(JavaScript) 
- Some errors did pop up when i validated my code using JSHint.com as I am using extensions like ATOM (I presume this was the cause of the error) I couldn't figure out how to fix this though as i tried removing and reastablishing my extensions. But nothing seemed to work. There were no other errors besides the extension errors though.

# Deployment
The site was deloyed to github pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the Github repository, navigate to the settings tab
- from the source section drop-down menu, select Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page provided the link to the completed website.
